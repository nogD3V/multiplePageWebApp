#  WEBAPP MADE WITH PYTHON üêç
### WITH SOME CODE, WE CAN CREATE A INTERFACE TO SHOW OUR PROJECTS WITHOUT CONFIGURING HTML, CSS, JS... (OFF COURSE WE CAN USE, BUT IT ISN'T NECESSARY).

Technology used:

Language:
  - PYTHON
  
 Libraries:
  - STREAMLIT

Concepts:

   - **In this WEBAPP we used PYTHON with the framework STREAMLIT to make a simple interface.**
  - **We used st.tabs to made the projects page.**
  - **We used the config.toml to change some page colors.** 
  - **We also used the system about multiple pages with a folder that streamlit understands that it is a multiple page.**
